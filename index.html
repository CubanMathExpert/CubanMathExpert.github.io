            <p>
                The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician 
                John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined 
                by its initial state, requiring no further input. 
                One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

            <p>
                It is a free video game with an ASCII interface in which the user is a robot on a 
                field of other random characters. Walking up to items allows robot to identify them as either kitten, 
                or any of a variety of "Non-kitten Items" with whimsical, strange or simply random text descriptions.

            <p>
                This game is a 2D arena combat platformer (Pixel Art). It is still in developement and will contain different 
                playable classes (rogue, templar, mage, etc). There will be numerous enemies with interesting and 
                challenging abilities. All the systems and AI's coded by me. The Art from the game is also created by me.
